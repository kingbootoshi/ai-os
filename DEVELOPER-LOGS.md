WHAT WORKS FROM CYPHER CORE
- seems like the FULL twitter functionality system + supabase system works great.

twitter integration:
- interacting with a new user saves the user to the database, specifically users (general), user accounts (connects users and their linked accounts), and finally individually platforms (in this case, twitter_user_accounts)
